Task 8. Collectors (photo)

The task: Build up a collection of scout scarves. First the base will take a picture of their scout scarves, all scarves open and taken in low res. After that the base will get in touch with other bases to manage a trade, but everything is virtual. The base must collect all scarves in its virtual album, following the criteria demanded in each album space and adding the name of the group’s donor, their city and state. There cannot be any repeated scarves. Go look for...
